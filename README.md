# 2-Players-Pong-Game
2 Players Pong Game
The Idea was taken from 100 days of code from Angela Yu.
I had done some modification such as: 
- I solved most of the situations on my own instead of followind the tutorial.
- Changing the ball bouncing when it touches the higher or the lower part of the paddle.
- This versios is a two players game.
- The ball will increase its speed every three times the paddles touches the ball.
